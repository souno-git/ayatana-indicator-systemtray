# Ayatana System Indicator -- Xembed System Tray

![](https://raw.github.com/AyatanaIndicators/ayatana-indicator-systemtray/master/ayatana-indicator-systemtray.png)

## Usage

FIXME! This part needs to be rewritten... Once we have deepened our understanding of this system indicator.

## Settings

To change the mode position: press the middle mouse button on the indicator.

The horizontal position can be changed: scrolling the mouse over the indicator.

Settings can be changed in gsettings:/org/ayatana/indicator/systemtray (use dconf-editor).

FIXME! The whole look and feel of the Xembed System Tray Indicator needs to be revisited.
